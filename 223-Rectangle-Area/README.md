# Rectangle Area Sum — Python Solution

This repository contains my Python solution for the **Rectangle Area Sum** problem on LeetCode.

## 🧩 Problem Summary

Given a set of rectangles, the task is to efficiently compute the **total area covered** by them. Overlapping regions must be counted **only once**.

## 🚀 My Approach

* Used an optimized Python solution.
* Handles overlapping rectangles.
* Ensures no double-counting of shared area.

## 📌 Features

* Clean and readable Python code
* Efficient logic for geometric computation
* Suitable for interview practice and competitive programming
